## Automation of Systems and Processes with Python

### Challenge:

To control costs, every day, your boss asks for a report with all the company's purchases of goods. Your job, as an analyst, is to send him an email, as soon as you start working, with the total amount spent, the quantity of products purchased and the average price of the products.

To solve this, we are going to use pyautogui, a keyboard and mouse command automation library.

PS: 
pyautogui.click -> mouse's click
# pyautogui.write -> write a text
# pyautogui.press -> press a key
# pyautogui.hotkey -> press a key combination (ex: Ctrl + D)
